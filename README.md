# PortfolioProject
This repository has code and queries for Marvel vs DC data exploration derived from Onyx Data. I created this data exploration to meet a data challenge. I did some simple calculations using the sql language to find out what is in the data and the difference between the variables. I hope you can provide some feedback on this data exploration and I hope you can find some insights from this repository for yourself.
